     ```

   - Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Set up the Frontend:**

   - Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the frontend directory:

     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```

   - Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the frontend development server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified by your setup) to start exploring modelmart.ai.

## Usage

- **Browsing Models:** Use the search bar on the homepage to find models by name or category.
